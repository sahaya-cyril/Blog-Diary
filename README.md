# Blog-Diary

This is a blog website made using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS templating. The home page of the website uses EJS templating to use a for loop to look up all the existing posts and render them to the screen. The Blog Schema consists of a title and content. I am using lodash to create custom post routes so that whenever a new post is generated it has its own route where the whole post can be read. The "/compose" route can be used to compose a post.
